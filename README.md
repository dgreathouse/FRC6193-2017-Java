# FRC6193-2017-Java
FRC 2017 Robot Code in Java

This code is used to drive the 2017 FRC robot for the 6193 team.<br>
The robot is configured as follows.

Subsystems<br>
1. Driveline<br>
   4 independent mecanum wheels with 8.45:1 gearboxes driven by CIM motors<br>
   1 Gyro for angle measurement<br>
   1 front facing Axis camera<br><br>
2. Fuel Shooter<br>
   Two 775Pro motors driving 4 four inch wheels on a single shaft for shooting fuel<br>
   One 1/2 inch shaft used to stop and load fuel. Shaft is driven by a window motor and is wraped with tape for grip.<br>
   A lexan box that holds around 30 fuel balls in four independent lanes.<br>
   The fuel shooter shoots fuel from the rear of the robot over the front of the robot.<br><br>
3. Fuel Intake<br>
   A front facing vertical lift system driven by 1 Mini CIM. The lift collects fuel off <br>
   the floor and uses pulley to make the fuel travel up the Fuel Tank and drop into the fuel tank<br>
   The fuel intake is around 20 inches wide to accomadate 4 fuel balls at a time.<br><br>
4. Gear Grabber<br>
   A field gear grabber that picks gears up off the floor. This gear grabbers uses a motor that spins connected gears<br>
   that have attached pinchers. When the gear is pinched a USB camera is used to show the co-driver that the gear is ready<br>
   to be lifted off the ground.  The gear spinner motor and gear lift motor are both KOP window motors. <br>
   The Gear Grabber is mounted on the Right side of the robot.<br><br>
5. Rope Climber<br>
   The rope climber uses a CIM motor with a 16:1 versa gearbox. The rope latching mechanism uses a gravity enabled hook and latch<br>
   system to make the rope wind on itself while the motor rotates the attached 1/2 hex shaft.<br>
   The Rope Climber is mounted on the left side of the robot.<br>
